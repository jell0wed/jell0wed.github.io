I am above all an ambitious and hardworking person who loves challenges. I constantly seek to deepen my knowledge in the foundations of computer sciences and its theorical aspects. I want to contribute to the field of computer science and work on large-scale projects that have a measurable social and technological impact on the international scene.

Over the years, I have perfected my skill set to be proficient in both back-end and front-end software development. I also had the chance to get involved in multiple research projects of various areas of computer science ranging from cyber security to health care.

My research interests lie in cyber security, mobile technologies and artificial intelligence.

I expect to graduate from McGill University (Montr√©al, Canada) in May 2018 with a degree in Computer Science. Finally, I am really thrilled to join Microsoft as a Software Engineer in the summer of 2018.
